config
======

I use a `git repo <http://github.com/kwgoodman/config>`_ to sync the config
files on my desktop and laptop. And to set up new computers.

Workflow: change a config file on one computer, then commit and push. To update
the other computer, just pull.

To set up a new computer, clone this repo. **Be careful**, I think cloning will
overwrite any config files you have.
